the web development efficient, quality and fun.

We want to thank [Fabien Potencier](@fabpot), the
[Symfony core team](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/core_team.html),

making the Symfony framework and its ecosystem a better place for everyone.

Thank you so much for all that you have done and do.

Signed,
